??? Questions ???

    * is CustID & Username necessary since email is unique?
    * password stored when user creates account and can login with that and edit account
    * really isnt much different from checking out without account
        - no account requires email &/Or order ID to lookup order?
    * ??? order changes without an account??? yes or no ???
