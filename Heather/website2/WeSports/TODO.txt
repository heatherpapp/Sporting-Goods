* Signup.css error on line 106

* Corners of page are oddly rounded:
    - thanks.html

* Create Cart.html to show cart
    When a customer checks out:
        - Show cart
            with buttons/links to:
                * Login then Checkout
                * Checkout without Logging in
            - confirm billing and shipping info
                * billing info will NOT be processed --- dummy fields, no table for storage
                * shipping info WILL BE stored in Customer table

* Business Objects:
    - Customer
    - Distributor
    - Cart
    - Product
    - ProductList
    - Checkout

* Servlets:
    - CustomerLoginServlet

??? Questions ???

    * is CustID & Username necessary since email is unique?
    * password stored when user creates account and can login with that and edit account
    * really isnt much different from checking out without account
        - no account requires email &/Or order ID to lookup order?
    * ??? order changes without an account??? yes or no ???
